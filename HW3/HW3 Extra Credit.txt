 Unit testing is the process of testing small pieces or groups of pieces (Methods, classes, etc.) 
 of code seperately. It makes sure each piece works well on its own. Test driven development is 
 where a specific test is made to check each piece (method, class, option, corner case) of code
 before the code is written. If a program passes all the tests, it is almost guaranteed that the
 program will work as expected. However, if the tests are not written with good forthought it can 
 confine the developer into writing sloppy and inefficient code.
